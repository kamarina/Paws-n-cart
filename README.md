# Paws-n-cart
The program simulates a simple pet shopping cart system.
"""
It consists of two classes:
- PetProduct: Represents a pet product with attributes such as name, price, and quantity.
- ShoppingCart: Represents a shopping cart that allows users to add, remove, and view pet products.

The ShoppingCart class includes methods for managing the shopping cart:
- add_to_cart: Adds a specified quantity of a product to the cart or updates the quantity if the product is already present.
- remove_from_cart: Removes a specified quantity of a product from the cart or removes the product entirely.
- view_cart: Displays the contents of the shopping cart and calculates the total cost.
- display_available_products: Displays a list of available pet products for users to choose from.

The program provides a sample usage section where users can interact with the shopping cart through a menu:
1. Add item to cart
2. Remove an item from a cart
3. View cart
4. Checkout and exit

Users can select options, input product quantities, and manage their shopping cart until they choose to checkout and exit the program.

This program is designed to showcase a basic understanding of classes, methods, user input handling, and simple interaction with a shopping cart system.
